# This module takes in a variable which says how many articles are in the "Data/raw" directory. It will then open the first of those files, named article_1_raw.txt, and
# store all of its HTML data in the variable rawData. It will then close the file and open a new file called article_1.txt, and in article_1.txt it will put in the
# processed text, which is when the raw data has all of the HTML tags removed and all of the whitespace stripped. Then it closes article_1.txt and moves on to the next
# file until it has processed all of the files in the "Data/raw" directory. It also stores all of these processed files into the "Data/processed" directory.
